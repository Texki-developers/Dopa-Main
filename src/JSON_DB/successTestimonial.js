There,the experienced subject experts would conduct the classes in a good manner. What sets dopa apart in my opinion is the mentorship and expert advises. The  mentors are MBBS students who have cracked neet in recent years. It will help us to get good guidance. There was lot people to hear us and they help us to sort out our problems.Apart from academics i got mental and emotional support which is very important in neet journey.  Literally i got stress free campus there. We can listen to stories of many doctor faculties which will motivate us a lot.I'm so happy  and proud to be a part of dopa for achieving my dream.

      "Hi, I'm Priya Vijay. I was a student of DOPA Residential Repeaters batch, preparing for NEET 2023. DOPA was the only reason for why I was able to crack NEET'23. They worked as a team to help us successfully get through our NEET journey. They provided us with detailed lectures on all chapters and doubt solving sessions by well-experienced faculty. The one thing I really like about there is the stress-free atmosphere. It feels more like a home away from home than a coaching institute. They supported us in every way to keep ourselves motivated and hardworking. They were always there to lend us a helping hand through our ups and downs at every point of our journey. I am proud to be a part of the DOPA family. And thank you DOPA for being a part of my journey towards my dream.‚ù§",
