    review: `I was searching for a good NEET school after my 10th
        grade, my decision to join DOPA was really correct. When 
       I thought about the other NEET schools, we have a lot of 
       extracurricular activities over here. Thank you DOPA!`,

    review: `DOPA helped me believe I can be a doctor. It’s not just 
        about learning; it’s about studying in a smart way. DOPA 
        taught me that working smart is more important than 
        working hard.`,
